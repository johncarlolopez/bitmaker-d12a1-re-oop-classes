# 01 - Reinforcing Exercises: Programming Fundamentals
### Tuesday, Dec 19th

## Exercise 1
___
Create an emotions hash, where the keys are the names of different human emotions and the values are the degree to which the emotion is being felt on a scale from 1 to 3.

## Exercise 2
___
Write a ```Person``` class with the following characteristics:

1. name (string)
1. emotions (hash)

Initialize an instance of ```Person``` using your emotions hash from exercise 1.

## Exercise 3
___
Add an instance method to your class that displays a message describing how the person is feeling. Substitute the words "high", "medium", and "low" for the emotion levels 1, 2, and 3.

For example:
```
I am feeling a high amount of happiness.
I am feeling a medium amount of stress.
I am feeling a low amount of fear.
```
would be the output for the hash
```
{ happiness: 3, stress: 2, fear: 1 }
```
Try it out to make sure the method works.
